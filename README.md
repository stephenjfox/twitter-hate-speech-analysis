# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

An [Analytics Vidhya practice problem](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-twitter-sentiment-analysis/)

## Problem Statement

> The objective of this task is __to detect hate speech in tweets__.
  * For the sake of simplicity, we say a `tweet` contains "hate speech" __if it has a racist or sexist sentiment associated with it__.
  * So, __the task is to classify racist or sexist tweets__ from other tweets.

> Formally:
 * Given a training sample of tweets and labels, where label `1` denotes the tweet is racist/sexist and label `0` denotes the tweet is not racist/sexist, your objective is to predict the labels on the test dataset.
